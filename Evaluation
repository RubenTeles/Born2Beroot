======================== Mandatory Part ======================

Q: Why Debian?
A: It's easier to install and configure than CentOS (and i haven't use CentOS befoe)

Q: What is virtual machine?
A: A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy 
apps. Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all
running on the same host. For example, you can run a virtual MacOS machine on a physical PC. 

Q: What it's purpose?
A: VMs may be deployed to accommodate different levels of processing power needs, to run software that requires a different
operating system, or to test applications in a safe, sandboxed environment. 

Q: How does it works?
A: VM working through "Virtualization" technology. Virtualization uses software to simulate virtual hardware that allows 
VMs to run on a single host machine.

Q: Diff between aptitude and apt?
A: Aptitude is a high-level package manager while APT is lower-level package manager which can be used by other 
higher-level package managers

Q: What is AppArmor?
A: AppArmor ("Application Armor") is a Linux kernel security module that allows the system administrator to restrict programs'
capabilities with per-program profiles.

Q: What is SSH?
A: SSH, also known as Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, is a network protocol that gives users, particularly system 
administrators, a secure way to access a computer over an unsecured network.

======================== Simple Setup ========================

Password Rules: .-abCD1234
Check UFW:      sudo ufw status
Check SSH:      sudo service ssh status
Check Debian:   hostnamectl

======================== User ========================

Check Group "sudo":   getent group sudo
Check Group "user42": getent group user42

PassWord Policy:      vim /etc/pam.d/common-password

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
| You have to create a new user here.        |
| $ sudo adduser username                    | <- creating new user (yes (no))
| $ sudo chage -l username                   | <- Verify password expire info for new user
| $ sudo adduser username sudo               |
| $ sudo adduser username user42             | <- assign new user to sudo and user42 groups
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

======================== Hostname and partitions ========================

Check Hostname:     hostname
Modify hostname:    1- hostnamectl 2- sudo -s 3- hostnamectl set-hostname <name> 3- vi /etc/hosts 4- exit 5- hostnamectl
Partitions for VM:  lsblk

LVM - Logical Volume Management is a form of storage virtualization that offers system administrators a more flexible
approach to managing disk storage space than traditional partitioning. 
This type of virtualization tool is located within the device-driver stack on the operating system.

======================== SUDO ========================

Properly installed: sudo apt update (if are updates run sudo apt upgrade)
Add user in sudo:   sudo adduser <name> sudo
Rules for Sudo:     ????????
Verrify directory:  cd /var/log/sudo
Verify the logs:    1 - sudo 2- sudo vi /var/log/sudo/sudo.log

======================== UFW ========================

Properly installed: sudo apt install ufw
Check working:      sudo ufw status
What is UFW:
Add New Port and Delete: 1- sudo ufw allow 8080 2- sudo ufw status 3- sudo ufw delete (rulle number)

======================== SSH ========================

Properly installed: sudo apt install ssh
Check working:      sudo service ssh status
What is SSH:
Check working:      sudo service ssh status
Finnaly:            ssh -p 4242 <user>@<ip>


======================== Script ========================

How Script works: sudo vim /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh
cron: The software utility cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems.
      The origin of the name cron is from the Greek word for time, χρόνος (chronos). Cron is most suitable for scheduling repetitive tasks. 
      Scheduling one-time tasks can be accomplished using the associated at utility.
script run every 10 mins: sudo crontab -e
How change for 1:
|***************************************************|
| */10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh         |
| @reboot sleep 10; sh /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh |
|***************************************************|

|***************************************************|
| */1 * * * * /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh          |
| @reboot sleep 10; sh /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh |
|***************************************************|
To stop script running on boot you just need to remove or commit
|********************************|
| @reboot /path/to/monitoring.sh |
